    "\n",
    "### Git\n",
    "- Git is a version control tool that track changes in your project. \n",
    "- instead of creating multiple files for every version of the project.\n",
    "    - ex: project_file_v1 , project_file_v2, project_file_v3, etc..\n",
    "- git can save a snapshots of the project (called commits).\n",
    "    - ex: commit 1, commit 2, commit 3, etc..\n",
    "    - instead of saving a new file for each project version, git saves (commits) a snapshot of the project  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository \n",
    "- to setup a file and track its versions (changes) using git, a git repository must be initialized\n",
    "- when a repo is initialized a hidden .get folder is generated that tracks a project folder staged files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Staged Files\n",
    "- any file in a repo can be tracked; however, not all files need to be tracked. (ex: raw data)\n",
    "- in a new repo all files are un-staged (git is not tracking them)\n",
    "- git start tracking a file when it is staged\n",
    "- note (un-staged files): git is used to track changes to code adding data files will bloat the repo\n",
    "- note: Github allows only 25MB limit on its cloud repo and the max local repo size is 10GB, so only stage necessary files only\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Ignore \n",
    "- to avoid staging certain files or file types git ignore files track all unwanted files and removes them from the staging selection \n",
    "\n",
    "### Commits\n",
    "- after staging all files that needs to be tracked we can star committing after making changes to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Push Repo\n",
    "- when creating a commit the project is saved locally on the system\n",
    "- to share the project to a new remote repository to be accessed online we can publish the repo to github\n",
    "- to update the repos online with the latest commits we can commit and push the repo on git hub\n",
    "- note: you must have a git hub account and specify your username and password\n",
    "- note: when pushing a repo to an existing github repo, the github repo URL must be specified \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project structure\n",
    "- every project should have a consistent file structure to easily navigate the project\n",
    "- future improvement: read cookiecutter datascience docs and watch some vids\n",
