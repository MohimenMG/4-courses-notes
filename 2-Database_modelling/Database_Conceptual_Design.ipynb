    "__External:__ \n",
    "- An external schema is the view of the database from the perspective of a particular user or application. It defines how the data is presented to the user and what data is visible to them. External schemas allow users to access and manipulate data without having to be concerned with how the data is stored or organized internally.\n",
    "- Example: a data mart is a type of external schema were a specific data (ex: HR) is extracted form the main warehouse and summarized for a specific user to access\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conceptual:__ \n",
    "- A conceptual schema is a high-level description of the entire database. It defines the overall structure of the database, including the relationships between different data elements. The conceptual schema is designed to be independent of any specific database management system and is often represented using an entity-relationship (ER) diagram.\n",
    "- Example: a data warehouse is a type of conceptual schema where all data is centralized in one source logically organized according to ER\n",
    "\n",
    "__Physical:__ \n",
    "- A physical schema describes how the data is physically stored in the database. It includes details such as the data storage format, the indexing strategy, and the physical location of the data on the storage device. The physical schema is closely tied to the specific database management system being used.\n",
