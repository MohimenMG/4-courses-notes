    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Data warehousing is a technique used to consolidate data from multiple sources into a single, centralized repository for faster querying, analysis, and reporting\n",
    "- Example: In large businesses that deal with frequent transactions on different servers, data is often distributed across multiple systems and databases, making it difficult to query and analyze in real-time. By consolidating this data into a data warehouse, businesses can create a single source of truth for all their data, making it easier to access, analyze, and report on.\n",
    "- typically a data warehouse:\n",
    "    - its optmized for data querying (read operations)\n",
    "    - incrementaly loaded with new data at regular intervals (write operations)"

    "- __centralized data warehouse:__ \n",
    "    - centralized data warehouse is a large storage that contains multiple databases, each of which corresponds to a specific subject area or a department of an organization. Each database contains strictly defined tables and columns that hold all the historical data needed for analysis.\n",
    "    - users pull data directly from the warehouse for analysis\n",
    "- __hub-and-spoke:__\n",
    "   - is a centralized data warehouse complimented by data marts\n",
    "   - users pull data from their respective data mart at much higher speed\n",
    "    - __data mart:__\n",
    "       - The process of creating a data mart involves selecting and summarizing the data from the larger data warehouse in a way that is relevant and useful to a specific business unit or department. The data is then transformed into a format that is optimized for fast querying and analysis, and loaded into a separate physical storage.\n",
    "       - provide faster query time (less computation expences) but duplicates the data so requires additional space (more storage expenses)"

    "## Fact Tables\n",
    "- A fact table is a table in a data warehouse that stores the quantitative data or measurements of a business process or event. It typically contains the foreign keys that link to related dimension tables, as well as the numeric values that are used to perform calculations, such as sums, averages, and other statistical functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- For example, in the a retail store where there are an order and product tables (for simplicity each order have one product only):\n",
    "    1. the fact table can be interpreted as a join between the order and product tables\n",
    "    2. the columns selected include foreign key from the order and product table (dimension tables primary keys)\n",
    "    3. the columns selected also include key numeric metrics like quantity and price\n",
    "    4. the fact table can provide complex analysis by aggregating the numeric columns without multiple complex joins\n",
    "        - ex: calculating the total revenue for a specific product category\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```sql\n",
    "            SELECT SUM(sales) \n",

    "\n",
    "    5. the fact table can be joined with a dimension table to provide additional information a\n",

    "            FROM  fact_table f\n",
    "            JOIN customer c ON c.id = f.id\n",

    "            HAVING c.customer_segment = 'segment'\n",
    "            ORDER BY cnt DESC\n",
    "            -- this query would have required multiple joins but the fact table reduced the number of joins to 1\n",

    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually its computationally expensive to query the fact table like results through joins, so a fact table is defined in the warehouse schema taking more storage space but saving computational resources as a form of de-normalization.\n",

    "- a data warehouse should have one truth table for every process:\n",
    "    - if two databases are related to the same process the truth table should be a join between the dimension tables of the two databases"
