    "- accessible and easy to interact with, and provide numerous way to display data.\n",
    "- provide fast query performance.\n",
    "- its data quality must be insured and only deployed when it is validated.\n",
    "- its data must be consistent from all sources.\n",
    "- the warehouse should handle changes, new data, new application, and new business requirements without affecting the data warehouse operations.\n",
    "- fast to deliver raw data to operation business users\n",
    "- the warehouse must control access to the data to protect the business data\n",
    "- the data warehouse must be accepted by the business users (if the solution doesn't improve the business user workflow it wont be used)"
